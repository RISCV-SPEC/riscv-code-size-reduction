Synopsis::
Move two s0-s7 registers into a0-a1

Mnemonic::
cm.mva01s _r1s'_, _r2s'_

Encoding (RV32, RV64)::

    { bits:  2, name: 0x2,      attr: ['C2'] },

Assembly Syntax::

[source,sail]
--
cm.mva01s r1s', r2s'
--

Description::
This instruction moves _r1s'_ into _a0_ and _r2s'_ into _a1_. 
The execution is atomic, so it is not possible to observe state where only one of _a0_ or _a1_ have been updated.

The encoding uses _sreg_ number specifiers instead of _xreg_ number specifiers to save encoding space. 
The mapping between them is specified in the pseudo-code below.

[NOTE]

  The _s_ register mapping is taken from the UABI, and may not match the currently unratified EABI. _cm.mva01s.e_ may be included in the future.

Prerequisites::
None

32-bit equivalent::
No direct equivalent encoding exists.

Operation::

//This is not SAIL, it's pseudo-code. The SAIL hasn't been written yet.

xreg2 = {r2sc[2:1]>0,r2sc[2:1]==0,r2sc[2:0]};
X[10] = X[xreg1];
X[11] = X[xreg2];
